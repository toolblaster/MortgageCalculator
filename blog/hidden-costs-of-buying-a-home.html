                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Generally, no. In most transactions in the US and Canada, the seller pays the commission for both their agent and the buyer's agent from the proceeds of the sale. While this cost is factored into the home's price, it's not an out-of-pocket expense you need to budget for at closing.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Some of them, yes. Fees charged directly by the lender (like origination or application fees) may be negotiable. Third-party costs (like appraisal and title insurance) are less flexible, but you can shop around for different providers. You can also ask the seller to contribute to closing costs as part of your offer.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is an ongoing cost required if your down payment is less than 20%. It protects the lender, not you. While it should be clearly disclosed on your loan estimate, many buyers forget to factor this extra monthly charge into their long-term budget.</p>
